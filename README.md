# AI Soundscape

This is the source code of the AI Soundscape project. Which tries to create a sound that recreates an environment. It does this by spectral analysis and a neural network that uses such components as training data. 

# Files

This project is divided into data processing and the neural network.

## AI

In this folder everything regarding the neural network is located:

- soundscape.py: Main file that defines the structure of the neural network and trains it using the trainer.
- trainer.py: Trainer file that contains the single epoch run function, the training procedure and a function to generate new data with a trained model.
- generator.py: File that creates data from silence and from noise using a trained model.
- utils.py: Helper functions.


## DataGenerated

This folder contains raw data in .mat files that were generated using the neural network.

## DataProcess

In this folder everything regarding the data processing and is included the raw data generated as .mat files:

- Audio_processing.m: File that charges the audio and generate a .mat file with the real and imaginary part of the fast fourier transform with components reduced.

## SoundGenerator

This folder contains everything regarding the sound generator: 

-Sound_generator.m: File that takes the data and generate an audio file starting of the data generated by the AI.
